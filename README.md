If you're lazy like me and are tired of having to manually sync reactor's full length reactions to the episode they're watching, then this tool is for you. This script automatically detects when reactors start playing the episode, syncs it with your copy, then merges them into one video file. While this was originally made for the SOS Bro's reactions, this will work with any reactor who has the episode preview in the bottom left corner of the screen. Do note that if you don't have an Nvidia graphics card then this script will take quite a while to run as CPU encoding is very slow.

A preview of the program (graphic design is my passion):
